    <p>Hi there my name is Leon Carson.</p>
    <p>I am a student at Moringa SChool currently studying coding at the prep programme.</p>
    <p>For starters lets see how I look</p>
    <img src="images/leon.jpg" alt="A photo of Leon">
    <p>In the past few days I have created a few websites here and there</p>
    </div>
    <p>They include:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Monyoror/Spoon-Knife.git">Spoon-knife which explains about forking in Github</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Monyoror/hello-world.git">Hello-world which is actually my first website</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now to know about me a little bit right?</p>

    <p>As a kid due to a lot of work transfers of my parents studying in diffferent schools was the experience.
      But finally I got to do my KCPE at a school named Nyahururu Elite Group of schools located in the township of Nyahururu.</p>
    <p>Additionally I did my KCSE exam at Utumishi Academy located in Gilgil.</p>

    <p>Due to my young age I actually have a little bit of work experience as a waiter at a local hotel remotely known as Wambuku Hotel in Naivasha</p>

    <p>I decided to take a class in programming so as to help me have skills in becoming a fully pledged software engineer.All around my few life years I have been really interested in techknowledge hence on seeing that Moringa School offering the coding classes over a few months I couldnt resistt the offer since it takes a longer time in varsities.
       The classes also help me relate with people with at least the same interests as mine which I find really helpful since communication skills are key in the techworld so as to make good money.</p.>

    <p>As a young man am really interested in gaining more techknowledge.Inclusively I am interested in really good literature.</p>

    <p>Reading novels ,swimming and listening to music are just but a few of my hobbies.</p>
    <p>I also play basketball as a way of pasing time.</p>
